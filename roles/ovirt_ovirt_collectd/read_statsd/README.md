## ovirt_ovirt_collectd/read_statsd

This role configures collectd statsd plugin to collect virtual machines statistics,
CPU, memory, disk, and network I/O, from vdsm.

The available variables for this role are:

- `collectd_read_statsd_port:`  (default: `"8125"`)

  The port that collectd will listen on for incoming statsd data

- `collectd_read_statsd_bind_host:` (default: `"localhost"`)

  The address that collectd will listen on for incoming statsd data


In order to set these variable add the required variables to a file in
/etc/ovirt-engine-metrics/config.yml.d/ or in the command line.

For example, if you want to update the `collectd_read_statsd_port` to 8888,
you would need to run the Ovirt metrics configuration script like this:

::


    configure_ovirt_machines_for_metrics.sh -e "collectd_read_statsd_port=8888"


or add the following line to a file you create in /etc/ovirt-engine-metrics/config.yml.d/
and run configure_ovirt_machines_for_metrics.sh

::

    collectd_read_statsd_port: 8888

You don't need to update the configuration file if you wish to use default options.
