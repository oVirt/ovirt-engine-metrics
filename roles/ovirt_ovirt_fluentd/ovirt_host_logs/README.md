## ovirt_ovirt_fluentd/ovirt_host_logs

This role configures fluentd to parse oVirt hosts logs
and add additional metadata before sending them to the remote metrics store.

The following metadata is added to each metrics:

- `hostname`

  The hostname that the metric is collected from.

- `ipaddr4`

  The ipv4 address of the host the metric is collected from.

- `service`

  The name for the collected log file.

- `tag`

  This field can be used for several tags.
  Currently it holds the prefixs of the elasticsearch index the logs will be saved to. Like, project.ovirt-logs-<ovirt_env_name>


In order to set the required action there are the following variables


- `fluentd_pos_files_dir:`  (default: `"/var/lib/ovirt-fluentd/pos-files"`)

  Path to the Fluentd configuration directory.

- `fluentd_ovirt_vdsm_log_pos_file:` (default: `"{{ fluentd_pos_files_dir }}/ovirt-vdsm.log.pos"`)

  Path to the oVirt vdsm.log pos file.

- `fluentd_pos_files_mode:` (default: `"0640"`)

  File mode for Fluentd configuration files.

- `fluentd_pos_files_dir_mode:` (default: `"0750"`)

  File mode for Fluentd configuration directories.

- `configure_host_logs processing:` (default: `"true"`)
  Host log collection is turned on by default.
  If you do not wish to collect the vdsm.log, update this parameter to `false`.


In order to set these variable add the required variables to a file in
/etc/ovirt-engine-metrics/config.yml.d/ or in the command line.

For example, if you want to update `fluentd_pos_files_dir`,
you would need to run the Ovirt metrics configuration script like this:

::


    configure_ovirt_machines_for_metrics.sh -e "fluentd_pos_files_dir=/path/to/dir"


or add the following line to a file you create in /etc/ovirt-engine-metrics/config.yml.d/
and run configure_ovirt_machines_for_metrics.sh

::

    fluentd_pos_files_dir: /path/to/dir

You don't need to update the configuration file if you wish to use default options.
